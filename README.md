# Multi-Agent Hub

Welcome to my Multi-Agent AI Hub — a modular project housing a growing collection of custom-built AI agents designed for a wide variety of tasks. Each agent is developed using different tools, frameworks, and technologies to explore various approaches to automation, data analysis, and interaction.

## 🔧 Tech Used

- **Python** & **Java** – Core agent logic, utilities, and backend services
- **MongoDB** – Persistent storage for agent memory, metadata, and analytics
- **n8n** - Workflow platform for tying togther all the pieces of the puzzle
- **Render.com** – Hosting for web services, APIs, and background workers
- **Frameworks & APIs** – Each agent may utilize its own set of third-party tools, including REST APIs, AI/LLM integrations, and blockchain interfaces
- **Telegram/TG** - Global communication platform / messaging systems for agents to live on
- **Open AI / Anthropic** - Dialogue and basic conversation responses / wrapper script 

## 🗺️ Structure

🧩 The repo is organized into agent-specific directories. Each folder contains code, docs, and items relevant to that agent's function and purpose.
💭 Obviously way too many files and needs to be condensed ~ these are the goals!
